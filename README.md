# Website
Hey! Thanks for checking this repository out. It contains a demonstration of my HTML and CSS Skills. This project, in particular, is a single-page mini content website which teaches you git via an embedded youtube video. The website is actively responsive - ie it supports various screen sizes. Enjoy!
